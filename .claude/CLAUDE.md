# CLAUDE.md

Claude Code Plugin Marketplace - community plugins for enhancing Claude Code workflow.

## Language Policy

IMPORTANT: All content in this repository MUST be in English. This includes code, comments, documentation, commit messages, issues, and pull requests. This is a public repository for the global community.

## Project Structure

- Multi-plugin monorepo under `plugins/` using Bun workspaces
- Single `bun install` at root installs all workspace dependencies
- Single root `bun.lock` consolidates all dependencies
- Each plugin has `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest
- Plugins integrate via Claude Code hooks: SessionStart, Stop, Notification, SessionEnd
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` substituted at runtime for plugin paths

## Development Commands

```bash
# claude-monitoring plugin
cd plugins/claude-monitoring && bun test              # Run tests
cd plugins/claude-monitoring && bun test --watch      # Watch mode
cd plugins/claude-monitoring/web && bun run start     # Start server
cd plugins/claude-monitoring/web && bun run dev       # Dev server (TS watch + server)
bun run plugins/claude-monitoring/src/cli.ts <cmd>    # CLI execution
```
